# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio**.  
This repository showcases end-to-end data science projects demonstrating expertise in machine learning, predictive modeling, feature engineering, and data-driven decision-making.  

Each project is fully reproducible, with code, synthetic datasets, and reports included.  
The portfolio is structured so recruiters, hiring managers, and peers can explore real-world, production-style workflows.
